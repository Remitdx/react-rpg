Hi guys,

I am a fullstack web developper with Ruby on rails and now learning React.
This is my React + Vite demo. Fully designed and coded by myself.

Feel free to write me about this demo : 
 - please add content ! can you patch balance of the game ? hardcore is not hard enough !

- you also can submit a PR if some improvement can be done (animation, refactoring, ...)

Anyway, have fun with it and share it around !
